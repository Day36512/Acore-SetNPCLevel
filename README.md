# Acore-SetNPCLevel

THIS IS A WORK IN PROGRESS

Set's predefined npc's levels and modify their hp, damage, and spell damage per level. Right now it works best for reducing levels, working for the other way around. Read Lua file for details.
Pretty useless except for normalizing a bunch of mob levels for hit rating purposes.
I created this script mostly to mask ding visual for mobs spawning for an event. Was breaking my immersion ;)
This script is kinda buggy and doesn't apply to some npcs with the same npcid for some reason (I think it has to do with dynamic spawns). Just use Auto-Balance.
