# Acore-SetNPCLevel
Set's predefined npc's levels and modify their hp by 3% per level change. Read Lua file for details.
Pretty useless except for normalizing a bunch of mob levels for hit rating purposes.
I created this script mostly to mask ding visual for mobs spawning for an event. Was breaking my immersion ;)
This script is kinda buggy and doesn't apply to some npcs with the same npcid for some reason. Just use Auto-Balance.
