# Acore-SetNPCLevel
Set's predefined npc's levels and modify their hp by 3% per level change. Read Lua file for details.
Pretty useless except for normalizing a bunch of mob levels for hit rating purposes.
I created this script mostly to mask ding visual for mobs spawning for an event. Was breaking my immersion ;)
